# MLOps Project: Scikit-learn / MLflow Country Predictor
(images/basic_chart.gif)

Thanks for having a look at my project! Any way I took the Intel MLOps course, got familiar with things like data versioning and MLFlow and decided to do a project with it on AWS. 
lakeFS is a git like repository for data. MLFlow is a machine learning model repository and deployment pipeline. This makes dealing with multiple models floating around much easier to swap out. ArcGIS JS is a map front end that queries the MLFlow endpoint and spits out the model prediction in a clicky mappy sort of way that's fun to play with. Eventually I want to get these deployed to serverless endpoints via AWS SageMaker, but that's later.
